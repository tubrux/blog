## Introducing Tubrux: A Powerful Runtime-Assisted Static Analyzer for Java and Kotlin

Tubrux is designed to bring comprehensive vulnerability detection and security analysis to Java and Kotlin developers. This advanced analyzer goes beyond typical static code analysis by using runtime insights to pinpoint potential issues with exceptional accuracy. Let’s dive into some of the standout features Tubrux offers:

### Key Features

- **Non Thread-safe Data Structure Finder**  
  Identify data structures that are unsafe in multithreaded contexts. Tubrux scans for commonly used structures like `StringBuilder` and suggests alternatives, such as `StringBuffer`, or—if you're working with Kotlin—encourages coroutine-based solutions to achieve safe concurrency.

- **Potential XSS Vulnerability Finder**  
  Tubrux includes a specialized detector for potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, scanning your code for patterns that may open your application to client-side injection attacks. This helps you safeguard your application’s integrity and your users’ security.

- **Sensitive Data Finder**  
  Prevent exposure of sensitive data by identifying instances of hardcoded passwords, tokens, and other sensitive information in your source code. Tubrux's intelligent pattern-matching ensures that sensitive data is flagged, allowing developers to secure it before deployment.

- **Custom File Extension Support**  
  Flexibility is key with Tubrux’s custom extension support. Define which file extensions you want to analyze, giving you the ability to tailor the security scans specifically to your project's needs.

### Coming Soon

The Tubrux team is actively developing additional features to broaden its capabilities:

- **SQL Injection Potential Detection**  
  Identify possible SQL injection vulnerabilities, helping you avoid one of the most common and damaging types of attacks.

- **Android Support**  
  Expanding Tubrux to fully support Android applications, enhancing security analysis for mobile developers and broadening Tubrux’s utility across different platforms.

- **Insecure HTTP Usage Detection**  
  Detect insecure HTTP requests or the use of `HttpURLConnection` without SSL/TLS, helping you enforce secure communication standards.

- **Weak Cryptographic Algorithm Detection**  
  Detect usage of outdated or weak cryptographic algorithms, encouraging best practices for data encryption and security.
