### 1. Overview
Thread-safety issues typically occur when multiple threads access or modify shared data without proper synchronization, leading to unpredictable outcomes.

Using thread-safe data structures can help reduce thread-safety issues, including:

### 2. Race Condition
A race condition occurs when multiple threads try to read or modify shared data simultaneously without proper synchronization, leading to inconsistent or unpredictable results.

**Example Scenario:**
```
Initial State: counter = 0

  Thread-1                Thread-2               Thread-3
     |                       |                       |
     |---- Read (0) -------> |                       |
     |                       |---- Read (0) -------> |
     |                       |                       |---- Read (0) -------->|
     |-- Increment (+1)      |                       |                       |
     |                       |                       |                       |
     |-- Write (counter = 1) |                       |                       |
     |                       |-- Increment (+1).     |                       |
     |                       |                       |                       |
     |                       |-- Write (counter = 1) |                       |
     |                       |                       |-- Increment (+1)      |
     |                       |                       |                       |
     |                       |                       |-- Write (counter = 1) |

```

Each thread updates `counter` without synchronization, so the expected final result of 3 is incorrect and shows as 1 due to concurrent access. Race conditions can be challenging to detect, debug, and fix.

### 3. ConcurrentModificationException
This exception arises when a collection is modified (e.g., adding or removing elements) during an iteration in a multi-threaded environment. Collections like `MutableList`, `MutableSet`, and `MutableMap` throw this exception when modified structurally during iteration.

**Solution:** Use `assertFailsWith<ConcurrentModificationException>` in JUnit to validate this exception in a single-thread context. In multi-threaded contexts, the exception becomes even more likely, risking application crashes.

### 4. Deadlock
Deadlocks occur when threads wait indefinitely for resources held by each other. This is particularly dangerous as it halts application functionality, potentially leading to downtime.

**Example Deadlock Scenario:**

```
[Thread 1]                 [Thread 2]                  [Thread 3]
    |                          |                           |
    v                          v                           v
   Lock A ----> Waiting for   Lock B ----> Waiting for   Lock C ----> Waiting for
       ^                          |                           |
       |                          v                           v
Waiting for <---- Lock C    Waiting for <---- Lock A    Waiting for <---- Lock B
```

Just imagine, in a financial application that processes transactions, if a deadlock occurs, the transaction will not be completed and can potentially cause lost transaction data.

### 5. Conclusion
In summary, Kotlin provides multiple approaches to ensure thread-safety through data structures and synchronization mechanisms. By selecting the appropriate method, developers can mitigate risks like race conditions, `ConcurrentModificationException`, and deadlocks in multi-threaded applications.
